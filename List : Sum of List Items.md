# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

##  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

##  Program

```
items=[153,147,124,102]
print(sum(items))

```
## Output
<img width="368" height="214" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efb2aeed-fffe-47a9-b93b-ef72723097ae" />

## Result
